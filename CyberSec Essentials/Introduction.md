# Intro to CyberSecurity : ðŸ’€  

[Cybersecurity](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cyber-security-types-and-importance/) is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from theft, damage, unauthorized access, and attacks. It encompasses a range of technologies, processes, and measures designed to safeguard information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital assets.

## What does Security-Controls mean ?  

[Security controls](https://sprinto.com/blog/types-of-security-controls/#Types_of_security_controls_and_their_functions) are measures put in place to protect systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage.   

They can be classified into various categories based on their nature and purpose:  

- [Physical Controls](https://sprinto.com/blog/types-of-security-controls/#Types_of_security_controls_and_their_functions)   
- [Logical / Technical Controls](https://sprinto.com/blog/types-of-security-controls/#Types_of_security_controls_and_their_functions)   
- [Administrative Controls](https://sprinto.com/blog/types-of-security-controls/#Types_of_security_controls_and_their_functions)   

## User Lifecycle Management : 

[User Lifecycle Management (ULM)](https://www.simpletiger.com/resources/glossary/user-lifecycle) is the process of managing a userâ€™s identity and access rights throughout their association with an organization, from initial onboarding to final offboarding.   

his lifecycle involves several stages to ensure that users have appropriate access to resources while minimizing security risks. Effective ULM is critical for data security, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency.

### Access control model :
[Access control models](https://butterflymx.com/blog/access-control-models/) are frameworks that dictate how access rights and permissions are granted to users and systems. They define the policies and mechanisms for determining who can access what resources and under what conditions.   

   - [Discretionary Access Control](https://delinea.com/blog/access-control-models-methods)   
   - [Mandatory Access Control](https://delinea.com/blog/access-control-models-methods)   
   - [Role-Based Access Control](https://delinea.com/blog/access-control-models-methods)      
   - [Rule-Based Access Control](https://delinea.com/blog/access-control-models-methods)     


## Control Frameworks   

A [control framework](https://secureframe.com/blog/security-frameworks) is a structured set of guidelines, best practices, and standards that organizations use to manage risks and ensure compliance with regulations, policies, and operational objectives.   

It provides a systematic approach to establishing, implementing, and monitoring controls that protect the organizationâ€™s assets and data.  

### Examples of Control Frameworks:  

   - [COBIT](https://www.wallarm.com/what/what-is-cobit-control-objectives-for-information-technology) 
   - [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001)
   - [NIST SP 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final)
   - [PCI DSS](https://www.f5.com/glossary/payment-card-industry-data-security-standard-pci)


## Indicators of Compromise
[Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/indicators-of-compromise) are critical pieces of forensic data that suggest a security breach or malicious activity has taken place within a network or system.   

They help security teams identify, investigate, and respond to potential security incidents. IoCs can take various forms, ranging from technical data to behavioral signs.
